## Project Description

This project focuses on clustering and categorizing Netflix content, including TV shows and movies, into distinct groups based on various attributes. Clustering helps in organizing content for recommendation systems, enhancing user experience, and providing valuable insights to content creators. By applying machine learning and clustering techniques, we aim to discover patterns and relationships within the Netflix library.

## Dataset

**Description:** The dataset used in this project contains information about Netflix TV shows and movies. It includes features such as title, type (TV show or movie), release year, genre, director, cast, country, and more.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to prepare it for clustering.
- Data Visualization: Exploratory data analysis includes visualizations like bar plots, histograms, and word clouds to gain insights into the dataset's content.
- Feature Selection: Feature selection is performed to identify the most relevant attributes for clustering.

## Clustering Algorithms

Several clustering algorithms are applied to group Netflix content effectively:

1. **K-Means Clustering:**

   - Description: K-Means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that partitions data points into K clusters based on similarity.
   - Implementation: We utilize K-Means to cluster Netflix content into distinct categories.
   - Evaluation: Metrics such as within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) are used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

2. **Hierarchical Clustering:**

   - Description: Hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure of clusters, allowing for the discovery of hierarchical relationships.
   - Implementation: Hierarchical clustering is applied to create a dendrogram and organize content hierarchically.
   - Visualization: Dendrograms visually represent the hierarchical structure of clusters.

3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):**

   - Description: DBSCAN identifies clusters based on density, making it robust against outliers.
   - Implementation: DBSCAN helps detect content outliers and identify dense content clusters.
   - Evaluation: Metrics such as silhouette score assess the quality of DBSCAN clusters.

4. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):**

   - Description: LDA is a topic modeling technique that uncovers hidden topics within textual data.
   - Implementation: LDA is applied to analyze text-based attributes like plot descriptions to discover content topics.
   - Topics Identification: LDA identifies latent topics and their prevalence in the dataset.
